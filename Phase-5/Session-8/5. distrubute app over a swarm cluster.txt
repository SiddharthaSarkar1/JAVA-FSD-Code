********* Distribute Applicatione Accross the swarm cluster ********

step 1: create 2 instance one as dockermaster and anotherone as dockerworker in aws EC2

step 2: connet with both instances using mobaXterm

	install docker on both the instaces

	check version 
	create one image on both the instances

step 3: edit one hosts file to provide the IP address of master and worker

	go to dockermaster instance in mobaXterm

	sudo vi /etc/hosts file

	ipaddressOfMaster dockermaster
	ipaddressOfWorker dockerworker1 (copy private IPV4 address from your instances) 

	press esc
	type :wq! 
	enter

step 4: check wether the hosts file working or not 
	ping dockermaster
	to stop : ctrl + C
	ping dockerworker1
	to stop : ctrl + C

step 5: sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.81.162
	(IP address of master node)
	
	you will get one command to run on worker machine
	docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-58kdapnjy6tq4vd8vlpy7u528vo09azrk7396fmpskhvhpxlnx-bszc2q3t3hsrib3mbpgsx5lrf 172.31.81.162:2377
 	(from master machine copy the command and run on worker machine)
	if you get access denied error than type sudo before the command

step 6: go to master node and execute
	docker node ls

	you can see 2 nodes connected one is leader and another one is worker

step 7: execute one service with 2 replicas on master node

	docker service create --name clusterdemo --publish 8081:8081 --replicas 2 myimage

step 8: docker service ps clusterdemo
 	(this will show you one service is running on master node and another one is runnnig on server node
