****** run image on docker swarm *******

swarm means managing multiple conatiners running
on multiple hosts

------------------------------------
2 node : 1 node is manager and another node is worker

>docker swarm init
(it wil make my node as manager node and give one command, if you execute that command on another instaance --> that instance will connect to your manager node as worker.)

once swarm initialized check the running node

>docker node ls

Let's run the service on docker swarm

>docker service create -p 80:80 --name webserver myimage

>docker service ls (check running service)

>curl localhost:80

****** Scale the container with Docker swarm ***********

>docker service scale webserver=3

(this will scale your service with 3 services running)

to check service running

>docker service ls

to check howmany same services running

>docker service ps webserver

(you will be able to see 3 running services)
